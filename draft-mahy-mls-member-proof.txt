1.  Introduction

   The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) Protocol [RFC9420] is a group key
   management protocol which also provides group agreement on the
   membership and group context during each epoch.  This document
   defines a Safe Extension (Section 2 of [I-D.ietf-mls-extensions])
   that can be used for members to assert membership in the group to
   non-members (for example, an MLS Distribution Service), such that a
   dishonest assertion will be immediately apparent to other members.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
